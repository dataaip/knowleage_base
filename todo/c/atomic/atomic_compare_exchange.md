Atomically compares the contents of memory pointed to by `obj` with the contents of memory pointed to by `expected`, and if those are bitwise equal, replaces the former with `desired` (performs read-modify-write operation). Otherwise, loads the actual contents of memory pointed to by `obj` into `*expected` (performs load operation).

The memory models for the read-modify-write and load operations are `succ` and `fail` respectively. The (1-2) versions use memory_order_seq_cst by default.

The weak forms ((2) and (4)) of the functions are allowed to fail spuriously, that is, act as if \*obj != \*expected even if they are equal. When a compare-and-exchange is in a loop, the weak version will yield better performance on some platforms. When a weak compare-and-exchange would require a loop and a strong one would not, the strong one is preferable.

This is a generic function defined for all atomic object types `A`. The argument is pointer to a volatile atomic type to accept addresses of both non-volatile and volatile (e.g. memory-mapped I/O) atomic objects, and volatile semantic is preserved when applying this operation to volatile atomic objects. `C` is the non-atomic type corresponding to `A`.

It is unspecified whether the name of a generic function is a macro or an identifier declared with external linkage. If a macro definition is suppressed in order to access an actual function (e.g. parenthesized like (atomic_compare_exchange)(...)), or a program defines an external identifier with the name of a generic function, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| obj | - | pointer to the atomic object to test and modify |
| expected | - | pointer to the value expected to be found in the atomic object |
| desired | - | the value to store in the atomic object if it is as expected |
| succ | - | the memory synchronization ordering for the read-modify-write operation if the comparison succeeds. All values are permitted. |
| fail | - | the memory synchronization ordering for the load operation if the comparison fails. Cannot be memory_order_release or memory_order_acq_rel and cannot specify stronger ordering than `succ` |

### Return value

The result of the comparison: true if `*obj` was equal to `*exp`, false otherwise.

### Notes

The behavior of `atomic_compare_exchange_*` family is as if the following was executed atomically:

```
if (memcmp(obj, expected, sizeof *obj) == 0) {
    memcpy(obj, &desired, sizeof *obj);
    return true;
} else {
    memcpy(expected, obj, sizeof *obj);
    return false;
}

```
