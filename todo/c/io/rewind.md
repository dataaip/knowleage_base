| Defined in header `<stdio.h>` |  |  |
| void rewind( FILE \*stream ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Moves the file position indicator to the beginning of the given file stream.

The function is equivalent to fseek(stream, 0, SEEK_SET);, except that end-of-file and error indicators are cleared.

The function drops any effects from previous calls to ungetc.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stream | - | file stream to modify |

### Return value

(none)

### Example

This example shows how to read a file twice

Run this code

```
#include <stdio.h>
 
char str[20];
 
int main(void)
{
    FILE *f;
    char ch;
 
    f = fopen("file.txt", "w");
    for (ch = '0'; ch <= '9'; ch++) {
        fputc(ch, f);
    }
    fclose(f);
 
    f = fopen("file.txt", "r");
    fread(str, 1, 10, f);
    puts(str);
 
    rewind(f);
    fread(str, 1, 10, f);
    puts(str);
    fclose(f);
 
    return 0;
}

```

Output:

```
0123456789
0123456789

```
