1-3) Computes the base 2 logarithm of arg.4) Type-generic macro: If `arg` has type long double, `log2l` is called. Otherwise, if `arg` has integer type or the type double, `log2` is called. Otherwise, `log2f` is called.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arg | - | floating point value |

### Return value

If no errors occur, the base-**2** logarithm of `arg` (log2(arg) or lb(arg)) is returned.

If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where supported).

If a pole error occurs, -HUGE_VAL, `-HUGE_VALF`, or `-HUGE_VALL` is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in `math_errhandling`.

Domain error occurs if `arg` is less than zero.

Pole error may occur if `arg` is zero.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If the argument is ±0, -∞ is returned and FE_DIVBYZERO is raised.
- If the argument is 1, +0 is returned
- If the argument is negative, NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised.
- If the argument is +∞, +∞ is returned
- If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned

### Notes

For integer `arg`, the binary logarithm can be interpreted as the zero-based index of the most significant 1 bit in the input.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <float.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <fenv.h>
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
int main(void)
{
    printf("log2(65536) = %f\n", log2(65536));
    printf("log2(0.125) = %f\n", log2(0.125));
    printf("log2(0x020f) = %f (highest set bit is in position 9)\n", log2(0x020f));
    printf("base-5 logarithm of 125 = %f\n", log2(125)/log2(5));
    // special values
    printf("log2(1) = %f\n", log2(1));
    printf("log2(+Inf) = %f\n", log2(INFINITY));
    //error handling
    errno = 0; feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
    printf("log2(0) = %f\n", log2(0));
    if(errno == ERANGE) perror("    errno == ERANGE");

}

```

Possible output:

```
log2(65536) = 16.000000
log2(0.125) = -3.000000
log2(0x020f) = 9.041659 (highest set bit is in position 9)
base-5 logarithm of 125 = 3.000000
log2(1) = 0.000000
log2(+Inf) = inf
log2(0) = -inf
    errno == ERANGE: Numerical result out of range
    FE_DIVBYZERO raised

```
