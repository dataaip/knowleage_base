1-3) Extracts the value of the unbiased radix-independent exponent from the floating-point argument arg, and returns it as a floating-point value.4) Type-generic macros: If arg has type long double, `logbl` is called. Otherwise, if arg has integer type or the type double, `logb` is called. Otherwise, `logbf` is called.

Formally, the unbiased exponent is the signed integral part of logr|arg| (returned by this function as a floating-point value), for non-zero arg, where `r` is FLT_RADIX. If arg is subnormal, it is treated as though it was normalized.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arg | - | floating-point value |

### Return value

If no errors occur, the unbiased exponent of arg is returned as a signed floating-point value.

If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned.

If a pole error occurs, -HUGE_VAL, `-HUGE_VALF`, or `-HUGE_VALL` is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in `math_errhandling`.

Domain or range error may occur if arg is zero.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- If arg is ±0, -∞ is returned and FE_DIVBYZERO is raised.
- If arg is ±∞, +∞ is returned.
- If arg is NaN, NaN is returned.
- In all other cases, the result is exact (FE_INEXACT is never raised) and the current rounding mode is ignored.

### Notes

POSIX requires that a pole error occurs if arg is ±0.

The value of the exponent returned by `logb` is always 1 less than the exponent returned by frexp because of the different normalization requirements: for the exponent `e` returned by `logb`, |arg\*r-e  
| is between 1 and `r` (typically between 1 and 2), but for the exponent `e` returned by frexp, |arg\*2-e  
| is between 0.5 and 1.

### Example

    double f3;
    double f2 = modf(f, &f3);
    printf("modf() makes %.0f + %.2f\n", f3, f2);
 
    int i;
    f2 = frexp(f, &i);
    printf("frexp() makes %f * 2^%d\n", f2, i);
 
    i = logb(f);
    printf("logb()/logb() make %f * %d^%d\n", f/scalbn(1.0, i), FLT_RADIX, i);
 
    // error handling
    feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
    printf("logb(0) = %f\n", logb(0));
    if (fetestexcept(FE_DIVBYZERO))
        puts("    FE_DIVBYZERO raised");
}

```

Possible output:

```
Given the number 123.45 or 0x1.edccccccccccdp+6 in hex,
modf() makes 123 + 0.45
frexp() makes 0.964453 * 2^7
logb()/logb() make 1.928906 * 2^6
logb(0) = -Inf
    FE_DIVBYZERO raised

```
