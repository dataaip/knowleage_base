| Defined in header `<threads.h>` |  |  |
| int thrd_join( thrd_t thr, int \*res ); |  | (since C11) |
|  |  |  |

Blocks the current thread until the thread identified by `thr` finishes execution.

If `res` is not a null pointer, the result code of the thread is put to the location pointed to by `res`.

The termination of the thread **synchronizes-with** the completion of this function.

The behavior is undefined if the thread was previously detached or joined by another thread.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| thr | - | identifier of the thread to join |
| res | - | location to put the result code to |

### Return value

thrd_success if successful, thrd_error otherwise.
