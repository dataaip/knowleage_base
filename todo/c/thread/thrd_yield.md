| Defined in header `<threads.h>` |  |  |
| void thrd_yield(void); |  | (since C11) |
|  |  |  |

Provides a hint to the implementation to reschedule the execution of threads, allowing other threads to run.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

(none)

### Notes

The exact behavior of this function depends on the implementation, in particular on the mechanics of the OS scheduler in use and the state of the system. For example, a first-in-first-out realtime scheduler (`SCHED_FIFO` in Linux) would suspend the current thread and put it on the back of the queue of the same-priority threads that are ready to run, and if there are no other threads at the same priority, `yield` has no effect.

The POSIX equivalent of this function is `sched_yield`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <threads.h>
 
// utility function: difference between timespecs in microseconds
double usdiff(struct timespec s, struct timespec e)
{
    double sdiff = difftime(e.tv_sec, s.tv_sec);
    long nsdiff = e.tv_nsec - s.tv_nsec;
    if(nsdiff < 0) return 1000000*(sdiff-1) + (1000000000L+nsdiff)/1000.0;
    else return 1000000*(sdiff) + nsdiff/1000.0;
}
 
// busy wait while yielding
void sleep_100us()
{
    struct timespec start, end;
    timespec_get(&start, TIME_UTC);
    do {
        thrd_yield();
        timespec_get(&end, TIME_UTC);
    } while(usdiff(start, end) < 100.0);
}
 
int main()
{
    struct timespec start, end;
    timespec_get(&start, TIME_UTC);
    sleep_100us();
    timespec_get(&end, TIME_UTC);
    printf("Waited for %.3f us\n", usdiff(start, end));
}

```

Possible output:

```
Waited for 100.344 us

```
