| Defined in header `<numeric>` |  |  |
| template< class InputIt, class T >  T accumulate( InputIt first, InputIt last, T init ); | (1) | (constexpr since C++20) |
| template< class InputIt, class T, class BinaryOp >  T accumulate( InputIt first, InputIt last, T init, BinaryOp op ); | (2) | (constexpr since C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Computes the sum of the given value init and the elements in the range ``first`,`last`)`.

1) Initializes the accumulator acc (of type `T`) with the initial value init and then modifies it with acc = acc + \*i(until C++20)acc = std::move(acc) + \*i(since C++20) for every iterator i in the range `[`first`,`last`)` in order.2) Initializes the accumulator acc (of type `T`) with the initial value init and then modifies it with acc = op(acc, \*i)(until C++20)acc = op(std::move(acc), \*i)(since C++20) for every iterator i in the range `[`first`,`last`)` in order.

If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

- `T` is not [CopyConstructible.
- `T` is not CopyAssignable.
- op modifies any element of `[`first`,`last`)`.
- op invalidates any iterator or subrange in `[`first`,`last`]`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the range of elements to sum |
| init | - | initial value of the sum |
| op | - | binary operation function object that will be applied.   The signature of the function should be equivalent to the following:   Ret fun(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);  The signature does not need to have const &.  The type  Type1 must be such that an object of type T can be implicitly converted to  Type1. The type  Type2 must be such that an object of type InputIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to  Type2. The type Ret must be such that an object of type T can be assigned a value of type Ret. ​ |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`InputIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator. | | |

### Return value

acc after all modifications.

### Possible implementation

| accumulate (1) |
| --- |
| ```text template<class InputIt, class T> constexpr // since C++20 T accumulate(InputIt first, InputIt last, T init) {     for (; first != last; ++first)         init = std::move(init) + *first; // std::move since C++20       return init; } ``` |
| accumulate (2) |
| ```text template<class InputIt, class T, class BinaryOperation> constexpr // since C++20 T accumulate(InputIt first, InputIt last, T init, BinaryOperation op) {     for (; first != last; ++first)         init = op(std::move(init), *first); // std::move since C++20       return init; } ``` |

### Notes

`std::accumulate` performs a left fold "enwiki:Fold (higher-order function)"). In order to perform a right fold, one must reverse the order of the arguments to the binary operator, and use reverse iterators.

If left to type inference, op operates on values of the same type as init which can result in unwanted casting of the iterator elements. For example, std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0) likely does not give the result one wishes for when v is of type std::vector<double>.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
 
    int sum = std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0);
    int product = std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 1, std::multiplies<int>());
 
    auto dash_fold = [](std::string a, int b)
    {
        return std::move(a) + '-' + std::to_string(b);
    };
 
    std::string s = std::accumulate(std::next(v.begin()), v.end(),
                                    std::to_string(v[0]), // start with first element
                                    dash_fold);
 
    // Right fold using reverse iterators
    std::string rs = std::accumulate(std::next(v.rbegin()), v.rend(),
                                     std::to_string(v.back()), // start with last element
                                     dash_fold);
 
    std::cout << "sum: " << sum << '\n'
              << "product: " << product << '\n'
              << "dash-separated string: " << s << '\n'
              << "dash-separated string (right-folded): " << rs << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
sum: 55
product: 3628800
dash-separated string: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10
dash-separated string (right-folded): 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1

```
