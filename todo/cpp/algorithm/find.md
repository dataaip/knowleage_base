|  |  |  |

Returns an iterator to the first element in the range ``first`,`last`)` that satisfies specific criteria (or last if there is no such iterator).

1) `find` searches for an element equal to value (using `operator==`).3) `find_if` searches for an element for which predicate p returns true.5) `find_if_not` searches for an element for which predicate q returns false.2,4,6) Same as (1,3,5), but executed according to policy. These overloads participate in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true. | (until C++20) |
| std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true. | (since C++20) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the range of elements to examine |
| value | - | value to compare the elements to |
| policy | - | the execution policy to use |
| p | - | unary predicate which returns ​true for the required element.   The expression p(v) must be convertible to bool for every argument `v` of type (possibly const) `VT`, where `VT` is the value type of `InputIt`, regardless of value category, and must not modify `v`. Thus, a parameter type of VT&is not allowed, nor is VT unless for `VT` a move is equivalent to a copy(since C++11). ​ |
| q | - | unary predicate which returns ​false for the required element.   The expression q(v) must be convertible to bool for every argument `v` of type (possibly const) `VT`, where `VT` is the value type of `InputIt`, regardless of value category, and must not modify `v`. Thus, a parameter type of VT&is not allowed, nor is VT unless for `VT` a move is equivalent to a copy(since C++11). ​ |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`InputIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator. | | |
| -`ForwardIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator. | | |
| -`UnaryPredicate` must meet the requirements of Predicate. | | |

### Return value

The first iterator it in the range ``first`,`last`)` satisfying the following condition or last if there is no such iterator:

1,2) \*it == value is true.3,4) p(\*it) is true.5,6) q(\*it) is false.

### Complexity

Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as [std::distance(first, last):

1,2) At most \(\scriptsize N\)N comparisons with value using `operator==`.3,4) At most \(\scriptsize N\)N applications of the predicate p.5,6) At most \(\scriptsize N\)N applications of the predicate q.

### Exceptions

The overloads with a template parameter named `ExecutionPolicy` report errors as follows:

- If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and `ExecutionPolicy` is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called. For any other `ExecutionPolicy`, the behavior is implementation-defined.
- If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

### Possible implementation

| find |
| --- |
| ```text template<class InputIt, class T = typename std::iterator_traits<InputIt>::value_type> constexpr InputIt find(InputIt first, InputIt last, const T& value) {     for (; first != last; ++first)         if (*first == value)             return first;       return last; } ``` |
| find_if |
| ```text template<class InputIt, class UnaryPred> constexpr InputIt find_if(InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryPred p) {     for (; first != last; ++first)         if (p(*first))             return first;       return last; } ``` |
| find_if_not |
| ```text template<class InputIt, class UnaryPred> constexpr InputIt find_if_not(InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryPred q) {     for (; first != last; ++first)         if (!q(*first))             return first;       return last; } ``` |

### Notes

If C++11 is not available, an equivalent to `std::find_if_not` is to use `std::find_if` with the negated predicate.

|  |
| --- |
| ```text template<class InputIt, class UnaryPred> InputIt find_if_not(InputIt first, InputIt last, UnaryPred q) {     return std::find_if(first, last, std::not1(q)); } ``` |

### Example

The following example finds numbers in given sequences.

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <cassert>
#include <complex>
#include <initializer_list>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 
bool is_even(int i)
{
    return i % 2 == 0;
}
 
void example_contains()
{
    const auto haystack = {1, 2, 3, 4};
 
    for (const int needle : {3, 5})
        if (std::find(haystack.begin(), haystack.end(), needle) == haystack.end())
            std::cout << "haystack does not contain " << needle << '\n';
        else
            std::cout << "haystack contains " << needle << '\n';
}
 
void example_predicate()
{
    for (const auto& haystack : {std::array{3, 1, 4}, {1, 3, 5}})
    {
        const auto it = std::find_if(haystack.begin(), haystack.end(), is_even);
        if (it != haystack.end())
            std::cout << "haystack contains an even number " << *it << '\n';
        else
            std::cout << "haystack does not contain even numbers\n";
    }
}
 
void example_list_init()
{
    std::vector<std::complex<double>> haystack{{4.0, 2.0}};
#ifdef __cpp_lib_algorithm_default_value_type
    // T gets deduced making list-initialization possible
    const auto it = std::find(haystack.begin(), haystack.end(), {4.0, 2.0});
#else
    const auto it = std::find(haystack.begin(), haystack.end(), std::complex{4.0, 2.0});
#endif
    assert(it == haystack.begin());  
}
 
int main()
{
    example_contains();
    example_predicate();
    example_list_init();
}

```

Output:

```
haystack contains 3
haystack does not contain 5
haystack contains an even number 4
haystack does not contain even numbers

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 283 | C++98 | `T` was required to be EqualityComparable, but the value type of `InputIt` might not be `T` | removed the requirement |
