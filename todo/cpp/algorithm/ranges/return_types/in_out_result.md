|  |  |  |

`ranges::in_out_result` is a class template that provides a way to store two iterators as a single unit.

This class template has no base classes or declared members other than those shown below. Thus it is suitable for use with structured bindings.

All special member functions of this class template are implicitly declared, which makes specializations be aggregate classes, and propagate triviality, potentially-throwing-ness, and constexpr-ness of corresponding operations on data members.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I, O | - | the types of the objects that the `ranges::in_out_result` stores. |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member name | Definition |
| in | a value (that is supposed to be an iterator) of type `I`.   (public member object) |
| out | a value (that is supposed to be an iterator) of type `O`.   (public member object) |

All these members are declared with `[[no_unique_address]]` attribute.

### Member functions

## std::ranges::in_out_result::operator in_out_result<I2, O2>

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template<class I2, class O2>  requires std::convertible_to<const I&, I2> && std::convertible_to<const O&, O2> constexpr operator in_out_result<I2, O2>() const &; | (1) |  |
| template<class I2, class O2>  requires std::convertible_to<I, I2> && std::convertible_to<O, O2> constexpr operator in_out_result<I2, O2>() &&; | (2) |  |
|  |  |  |

Converts \*this to the result by constructing every data member of the result from the corresponding member of \*this.

1) Equivalent to return {in, out};.2) Equivalent to return {std::move(in), std::move(out)};.

### Standard library

The following standard library functions use `ranges::in_out_result` as the return type:

| ranges::move(C++20) | moves a range of elements to a new location (algorithm function object) |
| ranges::move_backward(C++20) | moves a range of elements to a new location in backwards order (algorithm function object) |
| ranges::transform(C++20) | applies a function to a range of elements (algorithm function object) |
| ranges::replace_copyranges::replace_copy_if(C++20)(C++20) | copies a range, replacing elements satisfying specific criteria with another value (algorithm function object) |

### Synopsis

```
namespace std::ranges
{
    template<class I, class O>
    struct in_out_result
    {
        [[no_unique_address]] I in;
        [[no_unique_address]] O out;
 
        template<class I2, class O2>
        requires std::convertible_to<const I&, I2> && std::convertible_to<const O&, O2>
        constexpr operator in_out_result<I2, O2>() const &
        {
            return {in, out};
        }
 
        template<class I2, class O2>
        requires std::convertible_to<I, I2> && std::convertible_to<O, O2>
        constexpr operator in_out_result<I2, O2>() &&
        {
            return {std::move(in), std::move(out)};
        }
    };
}

```

### Notes

Each standard library algorithm that uses this family of return types declares a new alias type, e.g. using merge_result = in_in_out_result<I1, I2, O>;.

The names for such aliases are formed by adding the suffix "**`_result`**" to the algorithm's name. So, the return type of `std::ranges::merge` can be named as `std::ranges::merge_result`.

Unlike std::pair and std::tuple, this class template has data members of meaningful names.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <cctype>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
 
int main()
{
    constexpr char in[] = "transform" "\n";
    std::array<char, sizeof(in)> out;
 
    const auto result = std::ranges::transform(in, out.begin(),
        [](char c) { return std::toupper(c); });
 
    auto print = [](char c) { std::cout << c; };
    std::ranges::for_each(std::cbegin(in), result.in, print);
    std::ranges::for_each(out.cbegin(), result.out, print);
}

```

Output:

```
transform
TRANSFORM

```
