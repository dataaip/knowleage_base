Replaces all elements in the range ``first`,`last`)` with new_value if they satisfy specific criteria.

1) Replaces all elements that are equal to old_value (using operator==).3) Replaces all elements for which predicate p returns true.2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy. These overloads participate in overload resolution only if all following conditions are satisfied:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true. | (until C++20) |
| std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true. | (since C++20) |

If \*first = new_value is invalid(until C++20)new_value is not writable to first(since C++20), the program is ill-formed.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first, last | - | the range of elements to process |
| old_value | - | the value of elements to replace |
| policy | - | the execution policy to use |
| p | - | unary predicate which returns ​true if the element value should be replaced.   The expression p(v) must be convertible to bool for every argument `v` of type (possibly const) `VT`, where `VT` is the value type of `ForwardIt`, regardless of value category, and must not modify `v`. Thus, a parameter type of VT&is not allowed, nor is VT unless for `VT` a move is equivalent to a copy(since C++11). ​ |
| new_value | - | the value to use as replacement |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`ForwardIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator. | | |
| -`UnaryPred` must meet the requirements of Predicate. | | |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as std::distance(first, last):

1,2) Exactly \(\scriptsize N\)N comparisons using operator==.3,4) Exactly \(\scriptsize N\)N applications of the predicate p.

### Exceptions

The overloads with a template parameter named `ExecutionPolicy` report errors as follows:

- If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception and `ExecutionPolicy` is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called. For any other `ExecutionPolicy`, the behavior is implementation-defined.
- If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

### Notes

Because the algorithm takes old_value and new_value by reference, it can have unexpected behavior if either is a reference to an element of the range ``first`,`last`)`.

| [Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_algorithm_default_value_type` | `202403` | (C++26) | List-initialization for algorithms (1-4) |

### Possible implementation

| replace |
| --- |
| ```text template<class ForwardIt,          class T = typename std::iterator_traits<ForwardIt>::value_type> void replace(ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last,              const T& old_value, const T& new_value) {     for (; first != last; ++first)         if (*first == old_value)             *first = new_value; } ``` |
| replace_if |
| ```text template<class ForwardIt, class UnaryPred,          class T = typename std::iterator_traits<ForwardIt>::value_type> void replace_if(ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last,                 UnaryPred p, const T& new_value) {     for (; first != last; ++first)         if (p(*first))             *first = new_value; } ``` |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <complex>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
 
void println(const auto& seq)
{
    for (const auto& e : seq)
        std::cout << e << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    std::array<int, 10> s{5, 7, 4, 2, 8, 6, 1, 9, 0, 3};
 
    // Replace all occurrences of 8 with 88.
    std::replace(s.begin(), s.end(), 8, 88);
    println(s);
 
    // Replace all values less than 5 with 55.
    std::replace_if(s.begin(), s.end(), 
                    std::bind(std::less<int>(), std::placeholders::_1, 5), 55);
    println(s);
 
    std::array<std::complex<double>, 2> nums{{{1, 3}, {1, 3}}};
    #ifdef __cpp_lib_algorithm_default_value_type
        std::replace(nums.begin(), nums.end(), {1, 3}, {4, 2});
    #else
        std::replace(nums.begin(), nums.end(), std::complex<double>{1, 3},
                                               std::complex<double>{4, 2});
    #endif
    println(nums);
}

```

Output:

```
5 7 4 2 88 6 1 9 0 3
5 7 55 55 88 6 55 9 55 55
(4,2), (4,2)

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 283 | C++98 | `T` was required to be CopyAssignable (and EqualityComparable for `replace`), but the value type of `ForwardIt` is not always `T` and `T` is not always writable to `ForwardIt` | required \*first = new_value to be valid instead |
