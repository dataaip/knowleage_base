Returns the number of elements in the container, i.e. std::distance(begin(), end()).

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

The number of elements in the container.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

The following code uses `size` to display the number of elements in a std::array:

Run this code

```
#include <array>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{ 
    std::array<int, 4> nums{1, 3, 5, 7};
 
    std::cout << "nums contains " << nums.size() << " elements.\n";
}

```

Output:

```
nums contains 4 elements.

```
