Returns an iterator to the first element of the `deque`.

If the `deque` is empty, the returned iterator will be equal to end().

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

Iterator to the first element.

### Complexity

Constant.

### Notes

libc++ backports `cbegin()` to C++98 mode.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <string>
#include <deque>
 
int main()
{
    std::deque<int> nums{1, 2, 4, 8, 16};
    std::deque<std::string> fruits{"orange", "apple", "raspberry"};
    std::deque<char> empty;
 
    // Print deque.
    std::for_each(nums.begin(), nums.end(), [](const int n) { std::cout << n << ' '; });
    std::cout << '\n';
 
    // Sums all integers in the deque nums (if any), printing only the result.
    std::cout << "Sum of nums: "
              << std::accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(), 0) << '\n';
 
    // Prints the first fruit in the deque fruits, checking if there is any.
    if (!fruits.empty())
        std::cout << "First fruit: " << *fruits.begin() << '\n';
 
    if (empty.begin() == empty.end())
        std::cout << "deque 'empty' is indeed empty.\n";
}

```

Output:

```
1 2 4 8 16
Sum of nums: 31
First fruit: orange
deque 'empty' is indeed empty.

```
