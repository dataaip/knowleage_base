| template< container-compatible-range<T> R >  iterator insert_range_after( const_iterator pos, R&& rg ); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Inserts, in non-reversing order, the copies of elements in rg before pos. Each iterator in the range rg is dereferenced exactly once.

pos must be any dereferenceable iterator in the range ``[`begin()``,``end()``)` or the `before_begin()` iterator (thus, `end()` is not a valid argument for pos).

No iterators or references become invalidated.

The behavior is undefined if rg overlaps with the container.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pos | - | an iterator after which the content will be inserted |
| rg | - | a container compatible range, that is, an `input_range` whose elements are convertible to `T` |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`T` must be EmplaceConstructible into `forward_list` from \*ranges::begin(rg). Otherwise, the behavior is undefined. | | |

### Return value

An `iterator` that points at the copy of the last element inserted into `forward_list` or at pos if rg is empty.

### Complexity

Linear in size of rg.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <forward_list>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    auto container = std::forward_list{1, 2, 3, 4};
    auto pos = std::next(container.cbegin());
    assert(*pos == 2);
    const auto rg = std::vector{-1, -2, -3};
 
#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
    container.insert_range_after(pos, rg);
#else
    container.insert_after(pos, rg.cbegin(), rg.cend());
#endif
 
    assert(std::ranges::equal(container, std::vector{1, 2, -1, -2, -3, 3, 4}));
}

```
