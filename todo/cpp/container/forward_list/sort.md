| void sort(); | (1) | (since C++11) |
| template< class Compare >  void sort( Compare comp ); | (2) | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Sorts the elements and preserves the order of equivalent elements. No references or iterators become invalidated.

1) Elements are compared using operator<.2) Elements are compared using comp.

If an exception is thrown, the order of elements in \*this is unspecified.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| comp | - | comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the requirements of Compare) which returns ​true if the first argument is **less** than (i.e. is ordered **before**) the second.   The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the following:  bool cmp(const Type1& a, const Type2& b);  While the signature does not need to have const&, the function must not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values of type (possibly const) `Type1` and `Type2` regardless of value category (thus, `Type1&` is not allowed, nor is `Type1` unless for `Type1` a move is equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).  The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type forward_list<T,Allocator>::const_iterator can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them. ​ |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`Compare` must meet the requirements of Compare. | | |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as std::distance(begin(), end()):

1) Approximately \(\scriptsize N \cdot log(N)\)N·log(N) comparisons using operator<.2) Approximately \(\scriptsize N \cdot log(N)\)N·log(N) applications of the comparison function comp.

### Notes

std::sort requires random access iterators and so cannot be used with `forward_list`. This function also differs from std::sort in that it does not require the element type of the `forward_list` to be swappable, preserves the values of all iterators, and performs a stable sort.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <forward_list>
 
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& ostr, const std::forward_list<int>& list)
{
    for (const int i : list)
        ostr << ' ' << i;
    return ostr;
}
 
int main()
{
    std::forward_list<int> list{8, 7, 5, 9, 0, 1, 3, 2, 6, 4};
    std::cout << "initially: " << list << '\n';
 
    list.sort();
    std::cout << "ascending: " << list << '\n';
 
    list.sort(std::greater<int>());
    std::cout << "descending:" << list << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
initially:  8 7 5 9 0 1 3 2 6 4
ascending:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
descending: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

```
