| template< container-compatible-range<T> R >  void assign_range( R&& rg ); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Replaces elements in the container with a copy of each element in rg.

All iterators (including the `end()` iterator) and all references to the elements are invalidated.

Each iterator in the range rg is dereferenced exactly once.

The behavior is undefined if rg overlaps with the container.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rg | - | an `input_range` with reference type convertible to the element type of the container |
| Type requirements | | |
| -std::assignable_from<T&, ranges::range_reference_t<R>> must be modeled. Otherwise, the program is ill-formed. | | |
| -`T` must be EmplaceConstructible into the container from \*ranges::begin(rg). Otherwise, the behavior is undefined. | | |

### Return value

(none)

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_containers_ranges` | `202202L` | (C++23) | Ranges-aware construction and insertion |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <list>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    const auto source = std::vector{2, 7, 1};
    auto destination = std::list{3, 1, 4};
#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
    destination.assign_range(source);
#else
    destination.assign(source.cbegin(), source.cend());
#endif
    assert(std::ranges::equal(source, destination));
}

```
