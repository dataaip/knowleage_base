| --- | --- | --- |
| template< class... Args >  std::pair<iterator, bool> emplace( Args&&... args ); |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Inserts a new element into the container constructed in-place with the given args, if there is no element with the key in the container.

The constructor of the new element (i.e. std::pair<const Key, T>) is called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to `emplace`, forwarded via std::forward<Args>(args)....
The element may be constructed even if there already is an element with the key in the container, in which case the newly constructed element will be destroyed immediately (see `try_emplace()` if this behavior is undesirable).

Careful use of `emplace` allows the new element to be constructed while avoiding unnecessary copy or move operations.

No iterators or references are invalidated.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| args | - | arguments to forward to the constructor of the element |

### Return value

A pair consisting of an iterator to the inserted element (or to the element that prevented the insertion) and a bool value set to true if and only if the insertion took place.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect (strong exception safety guarantee).

### Complexity

Logarithmic in the size of the container.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <utility>
#include <map>
 
int main()
{
    std::map<std::string, std::string> m;
 
    // uses pair's move constructor
    m.emplace(std::make_pair(std::string("a"), std::string("a")));
 
    // uses pair's converting move constructor
    m.emplace(std::make_pair("b", "abcd"));
 
    // uses pair's template constructor
    m.emplace("d", "ddd");
 
    // emplace with duplicate key has no effect
    m.emplace("d", "DDD");
 
    // uses pair's piecewise constructor
    m.emplace(std::piecewise_construct,
              std::forward_as_tuple("c"),
              std::forward_as_tuple(10, 'c'));
    // an alternative is: m.try_emplace("c", 10, 'c');
 
    for (const auto& p : m)
        std::cout << p.first << " => " << p.second << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
a => a
b => abcd
c => cccccccccc
d => ddd

```
