| void swap( map& other ); |  | (until C++17) |
| void swap( map& other ) noexcept(/\* see below \*/); |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

Exchanges the contents of the container with those of other. Does not invoke any move, copy, or swap operations on individual elements.

All iterators and references remain valid. The `end()` iterator is invalidated.
The `Compare` objects must be Swappable, and they are exchanged using unqualified call to non-member `swap`.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| If std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_swap::value is true, then the allocators are exchanged using an unqualified call to non-member `swap`. Otherwise, they are not swapped (and if get_allocator() != other.get_allocator(), the behavior is undefined). | (since C++11) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | container to exchange the contents with |

### Exceptions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Any exception thrown by the swap of the `Compare` objects. | (until C++17) |
| noexcept specification:noexcept(std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::is_always_equal::value  && std::is_nothrow_swappable<Compare>::value) | (since C++17) |

### Complexity

Constant.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <utility>
#include <map>
 
// print out a std::pair
template<class Os, class U, class V>
Os& operator<<(Os& os, const std::pair<U, V>& p)
{
    return os << p.first << ':' << p.second;
}
 
// print out a container
template<class Os, class Co>
Os& operator<<(Os& os, const Co& co)
{
    os << '{';
    for (auto const& i : co)
        os << ' ' << i;
    return os << " }\n";
}
 
int main()
{
    std::map<std::string, std::string>
        m1{{"γ", "gamma"}, {"β", "beta"}, {"α", "alpha"}, {"γ", "gamma"}},
        m2{{"ε", "epsilon"}, {"δ", "delta"}, {"ε", "epsilon"}};
 
    const auto& ref = *(m1.begin());
    const auto iter = std::next(m1.cbegin());
 
    std::cout << "──────── before swap ────────\n"
              << "m1: " << m1 << "m2: " << m2 << "ref: " << ref
              << "\niter: " << *iter << '\n';
 
    m1.swap(m2);
 
    std::cout << "──────── after swap ────────\n"
              << "m1: " << m1 << "m2: " << m2 << "ref: " << ref
              << "\niter: " << *iter << '\n';
 
    // Note that every iterator referring to an element in one container before
    // the swap refers to the same element in the other container after the swap.
    // Same is true for references.
}

```

Output:

```
──────── before swap ────────
m1: { α:alpha β:beta γ:gamma }
m2: { δ:delta ε:epsilon }
ref: α:alpha
iter: β:beta
──────── after swap ────────
m1: { δ:delta ε:epsilon }
m2: { α:alpha β:beta γ:gamma }
ref: α:alpha
iter: β:beta

```
