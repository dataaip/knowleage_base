`std::multimap` is an associative container that contains a sorted list of key-value pairs, while permitting multiple entries with the same key. Sorting is done according to the comparison function `Compare`, applied to the keys. Search, insertion, and removal operations have logarithmic complexity.

Iterators of `std::multimap` iterate in non-descending order of keys, where non-descending is defined by the comparison that was used for construction. That is, given

- m, a `std::multimap`
- it_l and it_r, dereferenceable iterators to m, with it_l < it_r.

m.value_comp()(\*it_r, \*it_l) == false (least to greatest if using the default comparison).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The order of the key-value pairs whose keys compare equivalent is the order of insertion and does not change. | (since C++11) |

Everywhere the standard library uses the Compare requirements, equivalence is determined by using the equivalence relation as described on Compare. In imprecise terms, two objects a and b are considered equivalent if neither compares less than the other: !comp(a, b) && !comp(b, a).

`std::multimap` meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer, AssociativeContainer and ReversibleContainer.
