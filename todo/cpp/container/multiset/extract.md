| node_type extract( const_iterator position ); | (1) | (since C++17) |
| node_type extract( const Key& k ); | (2) | (since C++17) |
| template< class K >  node_type extract( K&& x ); | (3) | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

1) Unlinks the node that contains the element pointed to by position and returns a node handle that owns it.2) If the container has an element with key equivalent to k, unlinks the node that contains the first such element from the container and returns a node handle that owns it. Otherwise, returns an empty node handle.3) Same as (2). This overload participates in overload resolution only if the qualified-id Compare::is_transparent is valid and denotes a type, and neither `iterator` nor `const_iterator` is implicitly convertible from `K`. It allows calling this function without constructing an instance of `Key`.

In either case, no elements are copied or moved, only the internal pointers of the container nodes are repointed (rebalancing may occur, as with erase()).

Extracting a node invalidates only the iterators to the extracted element. Pointers and references to the extracted element remain valid, but cannot be used while element is owned by a node handle: they become usable if the element is inserted into a container.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| position | - | a valid iterator into this container |
| k | - | a key to identify the node to be extracted |
| x | - | a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key identifying the node to be extracted |

### Return value

A node handle that owns the extracted element, or empty node handle in case the element is not found in (2,3).

### Exceptions

1) Throws nothing.2,3) Any exceptions thrown by the `Compare` object.

### Complexity

1) Amortized constant.2,3) log(size())

### Notes

extract is the only way to take a move-only object out of a set:

```
std::set<move_only_type> s;
s.emplace(...);
move_only_type mot = std::move(s.extract(s.begin()).value());

```

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_associative_heterogeneous_erasure` | `202110L` | (C++23) | Heterogeneous erasure in associative containers and unordered associative containers, (3) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
#include <set>
 
void print(std::string_view comment, const auto& data)
{
    std::cout << comment;
    for (auto datum : data)
        std::cout << ' ' << datum;
 
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    std::multiset<int> cont{1, 2, 3};
 
    print("Start:", cont);
 
    // Extract node handle and change key
    auto nh = cont.extract(1);
    nh.value() = 4;
 
    print("After extract and before insert:", cont);
 
    // Insert node handle back
    cont.insert(std::move(nh));
 
    print("End:", cont);
}

```

Output:

```
Start: 1 2 3
After extract and before insert: 2 3
End: 2 3 4

```
