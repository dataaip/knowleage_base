| template< container-compatible-range<value_type> R >  void insert_range( R&& rg ); |  | (since C++23) |
|  |  |  |

Inserts a copy of each element in the range rg if and only if there is no element with key equivalent to the key of that element in \*this.

Each iterator in the range rg is dereferenced exactly once.
The behavior is undefined if rg overlaps with the container.

No iterators or references are invalidated.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| rg | - | a container compatible range, that is, an `input_range` whose elements are convertible to `T` |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`value_type` must be EmplaceConstructible into `set` from \*ranges::begin(rg). Otherwise, the behavior is undefined. | | |

### Return value

(none)

### Complexity

N·log(a.size() + N), where `N` is ranges::distance(rg).

### Notes

| Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_containers_ranges` | `202202L` | (C++23) | Ranges-aware construction and insertion |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <set>
 
void println(auto, auto const& container)
{
    for (const auto& elem : container)
        std::cout << elem << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}
 
int main()
{
    auto container = std::set{1, 3, 2, 4};
    const auto rg = {-1, 3, -2};
#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
    container.insert_range(rg);
#else
    container.insert(rg.begin(), rg.end());
#endif
    println("{}", container);
}

```

Output:

```
-2 -1 1 2 3 4

```
