|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<system_error>` |  |  |
| template<>  struct is_error_condition_enum<std::errc> : std::true_type; |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Specifies that std::errc is an error condition enum. This enables implicit conversion to std::error_condition.

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| value[static] | true   (public static member constant) |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator bool | converts the object to bool, returns value   (public member function) |
| operator()(C++14) | returns value   (public member function) |

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `value_type` | bool |
| `type` | std::integral_constant<bool, value> |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| is_error_condition_enum(C++11) | identifies an enumeration as an std::error_condition   (class template) |
