| path temp_directory_path();  path temp_directory_path( error_code& ec ); | (1) | (filesystem TS) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the directory location suitable for temporary files.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A directory suitable for temporary files. The path is guaranteed to exist and to be a directory. The overload that takes `error_code&` argument returns an empty path on error.

### Exceptions

The overload that does not take an error_code& parameter throws filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed with path to be returned as the first argument and the OS error code as the error code argument. std::bad_alloc may be thrown if memory allocation fails. The overload taking an error_code& parameter sets it to the OS API error code if an OS API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur. This overload hasnoexcept specification:noexcept

### Notes

On POSIX systems, the path may be the one specified in the environment variables `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, `TEMP`, `TEMPDIR`, and, if none of them are specified, the path "/tmp" is returned.

On Windows systems, the path is typically the one returned by `GetTempPath`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Temp directory is " << fs::temp_directory_path() << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
Temp directory is "C:\Windows\TEMP\"

```
