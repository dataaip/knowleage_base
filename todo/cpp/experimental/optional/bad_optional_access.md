| Defined in header `<experimental/optional>` |  |  |
| class bad_optional_access; |  | (library fundamentals TS) |
|  |  |  |

Defines a type of object to be thrown by std::experimental::optional::value when accessing an optional object that does not contain a value.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a new `bad_optional_access` object   (public member function) |
| operator= | replaces the `bad_optional_access` object   (public member function) |
| what | returns the explanatory string   (public member function) |

## std::experimental::bad_optional_access::bad_optional_access

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bad_optional_access() noexcept; | (1) | (library fundamentals TS) |
| bad_optional_access( const bad_optional_access& other ) noexcept; | (2) | (library fundamentals TS) |
|  |  |  |

Constructs a new `bad_optional_access` object with an implementation-defined null-terminated byte string which is accessible through what().

1) Default constructor.2) Copy constructor. If \*this and other both have dynamic type `std::experimental::bad_optional_access` then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | another exception object to copy |

## std::experimental::bad_optional_access::operator=

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bad_optional_access& operator=( const bad_optional_access& other ) noexcept; |  | (library fundamentals TS) |
|  |  |  |

Assigns the contents with those of other.If \*this and other both have dynamic type `std::experimental::bad_optional_access` then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | - | another exception object to assign with |

### Return value

\*this

## std::experimental::bad_optional_access::what

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| virtual const char\* what() const noexcept; |  | (library fundamentals TS) |
|  |  |  |

Returns the explanatory string.

### Return value

Pointer to an implementation-defined null-terminated string with explanatory information. The string is suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member function (e.g. copy assignment operator) on the exception object is called.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The returned string is encoded with the ordinary literal encoding during constant evaluation. | (since C++26) |

### Notes

Implementations are allowed but not required to override `what()`.

## Inherited from std::logic_error

## Inherited from std::exception

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (destructor)[virtual] | destroys the exception object   (virtual public member function of `std::exception`) |
| what[virtual] | returns an explanatory string   (virtual public member function of `std::exception`) |
