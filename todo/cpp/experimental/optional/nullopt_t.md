`std::experimental::nullopt_t` is an empty class type used to indicate `optional` type with uninitialized state. In particular, std::experimental::optional has a constructor with `nullopt_t` as a single argument, which creates an optional that does not contain a value.

`std::experimental::nullopt_t` must be a LiteralType and cannot have a default constructor.

It must have a `constexpr` constructor that takes some implementation-defined literal type.

### Notes

`nullopt_t` is not DefaultConstructible to support both op = {}; and op = nullopt; as the syntax for disengaging an optional object.

A possible implementation of this class is

```
struct nullopt_t
{
    constexpr nullopt_t(int) {}
};

```
