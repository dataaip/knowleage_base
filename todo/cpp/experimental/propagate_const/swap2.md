| template< class T >  constexpr void swap( std::experimental::propagate_const<T>& lhs, std::experimental::propagate_const<T>& rhs ) noexcept(/\* see below \*/); |  | (library fundamentals TS v2) |
|  |  |  |

Specializes the swap algorithm for std::experimental::propagate_const. Swaps the pointers of lhs and rhs. Equivalent to lhs.swap(rhs).

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| This overload participates in overload resolution only if std::is_swappable_v<T> is true. | (library fundamentals TS v3) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | `propagate_const`s whose contents to swap |

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

noexcept specification:noexcept(noexcept(lhs.swap(rhs)))

### Complexity

Constant.
