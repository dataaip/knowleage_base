The concept `Swappable<T>` specifies that lvalues of type `T` are swappable.

The concept `SwappableWith<T, U>` specifies that expressions of the type and value category encoded by `T` and `U` are swappable with each other. `SwappableWith<T, U>` is satisfied only if a call to ranges::swap(t, u) exchanges the value of `t` and `u`, that is, given distinct objects `t2` equal to `t` and `u2` equal to `u`, after evaluating either ranges::swap(t, u) or ranges::swap(u, t), `t2` is equal to `u` and `u2` is equal to `t`.

### Equality preservation

An expression is **equality preserving** if it results in equal outputs given equal inputs.

- The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
- The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands modified by the expression (if any).

Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required to be **stable**: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening modification of those input objects.

Unless noted otherwise, every expression used in a **requires-expression** is required to be equality preserving and stable, and the evaluation of the expression may only modify its non-constant operands. Operands that are constant must not be modified.
