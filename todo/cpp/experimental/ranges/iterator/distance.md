| Defined in header `<experimental/ranges/iterator>` |  |  |
| namespace {  constexpr /\* unspecified \*/ distance = /\* unspecified \*/; } |  | (ranges TS)  (customization point object) |
| Call signature |  |  |
| template< Iterator I, Sentinel<I> S >  constexpr ranges::difference_type_t<I> distance( I first, S last ); | (1) |  |
| template< Range R >  constexpr ranges::difference_type_t<ranges::iterator_t<R>> distance( R&& r ); | (2) |  |
| template< SizedRange R >  constexpr ranges::difference_type_t<ranges::iterator_t<R>> distance( R&& r ); | (3) |  |
|  |  |  |

Returns the distance between first and last, or between the beginning and the end of the range r.

1) If SizedSentinel<S, I> is satisfied, equivalent to return last - first;. Otherwise, returns the number of increments needed to get from first to last. If ``first`,`last`)` does not denote a range, then `I` and `S` must be the same type and must model [`SizedSentinel`, and ``last`,`first`)` must denote a range. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.2) Equivalent to return [ranges::distance(ranges::begin(r), ranges::end(r));.3) Equivalent to return ranges::size(r);.

Instantiating overloads (2,3) may be ill-formed if the header <experimental/ranges/range> is not included before the point of instantiation.

### Customization point objects

The name `ranges::distance` denotes a **customization point object**, which is a function object of a literal `Semiregular` class type (denoted, for exposition purposes, as `DistanceT`). All instances of `DistanceT` are equal. Thus, `ranges::distance` can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types `Args...`, if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to `ranges::distance` above, `DistanceT` will satisfy ranges::Invocable<const DistanceT, Args...>. Otherwise, no function call operator of `DistanceT` participates in overload resolution.

In every translation unit in which `ranges::distance` is defined, it refers to the same instance of the customization point object. (This means that it can be used freely in things like inline functions and function templates without violating the one-definition rule.)

### Return value

The distance between first and last, or between the beginning and the end of the range r.
