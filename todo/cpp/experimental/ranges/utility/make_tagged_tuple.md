| template< TagSpecifier... Tags, class... Types >      requires sizeof...(Tags) == sizeof...(Types) constexpr ranges::tagged</\*see below\*/, Tags...> make_tagged_tuple( Types&&... t ); |  | (ranges TS) |
|  |  |  |

Convenience function for creating a tagged tuple, deducing the element types from the arguments (the tag specifiers must be explicitly specified).

The **see below** portion of the return type is decltype(std::make_tuple(std::forward<Types>(t)...)).

### Return value

R(std::forward<Types>(t)...), where `R` is the return type.
