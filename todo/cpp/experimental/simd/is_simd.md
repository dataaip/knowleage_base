| Defined in header `<experimental/simd>` |  |  |
| template< class T >  struct is_simd; | (1) | (parallelism TS v2) |
| template< class T >  struct is_simd_mask; | (2) | (parallelism TS v2) |
|  |  |  |

1) If `T` is a specialization of the `simd` class template, provides the member constant value equal true. For any other type, value is false.2) If `T` is a specialization of the `simd_mask` class template, provides the member constant value equal true. For any other type, value is false.

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T | - | a type to check |

### Helper variable template

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template< class T >  constexpr bool is_simd_v = is_simd<T>::value; |  | (parallelism TS v2) |
| template< class T >  constexpr bool is_simd_mask_v = is_simd_mask<T>::value; |  | (parallelism TS v2) |
|  |  |  |

## Inherited from std::integral_constant

### Member constants

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| value[static] | true if `T` is a `simd`/`simd_mask` type, false otherwise   (public static member constant) |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| operator bool | converts the object to bool, returns value   (public member function) |
| operator()(C++14) | returns value   (public member function) |

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `value_type` | bool |
| `type` | std::integral_constant<bool, value> |

### Notes

is_simd_v<T> is necessary but not sufficient for testing whether `T` can be used as a SIMD type. For example, is_simd_v<simd<bool>> is true, even though bool is not included in the permissible vectorizable types. The missing condition is std::is_constructible_v<T>, which is false for simd<bool>.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <experimental/simd>
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
 
namespace stdx = std::experimental;
 
template<typename T>
void test_simd(std::string_view type_name)
{
    std::cout << std::boolalpha
              << "Type: " << type_name << '\n'
              << "  is_simd: " << stdx::is_simd_v<T> << '\n'
              << "  is_constructible: " << std::is_constructible_v<T> << '\n';
}
 
template<typename T>
void test_simd_mask(std::string_view type_name)
{
    std::cout << std::boolalpha
              << "Type: " << type_name << '\n'
              << "  is_simd_mask: " << stdx::is_simd_mask_v<T> << '\n'
              << "  is_constructible: " << std::is_constructible_v<T> << "\n\n";
}
 
int main() 
{
    test_simd<int>("int");
    test_simd_mask<int>("int");
 
    test_simd<stdx::simd<float>>("simd<float>");
    test_simd_mask<stdx::simd_mask<float>>("simd_mask<float>");
 
    test_simd<stdx::simd<bool>>("simd<bool>");
    test_simd_mask<stdx::simd_mask<bool>>("simd_mask<bool>");
}

```

Output:

```
Type: int
  is_simd: false
  is_constructible: true
Type: int
  is_simd_mask: false
  is_constructible: true
 
Type: simd<float>
  is_simd: true
  is_constructible: true
Type: simd_mask<float>
  is_simd_mask: true
  is_constructible: true
 
Type: simd<bool>
  is_simd: true
  is_constructible: false
Type: simd_mask<bool>
  is_simd_mask: true
  is_constructible: false
