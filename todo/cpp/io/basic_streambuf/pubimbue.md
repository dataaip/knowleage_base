Changes the associated locale.

1) Sets `loc` as the associated locale. Calls `imbue(loc)` of the most derived class2) The base class version of this function has no effect. The derived classes may override this function in order to be informed about the changes of the locale. The derived class may cache the locale and member facets between calls to `imbue()`.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| loc | - | locale object to associate |

### Return value

1) Previous associated locale.2) (none)

### Notes

From within the call of imbue(), `getloc()` returns the previous locale.
