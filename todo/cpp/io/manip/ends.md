| Defined in header `<ostream>` |  |  |
| template< class CharT, class Traits >  std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& ends( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Inserts a null character into the output sequence os as if by calling os.put(CharT()).

This is an output-only I/O manipulator, it may be called with an expression such as out << std::ends for any `out` of type std::basic_ostream.

### Notes

This manipulator is typically used with std::ostrstream, when the associated output buffer needs to be null-terminated to be processed as a C string.

Unlike std::endl, this manipulator does not flush the stream.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| os | - | reference to output stream |

### Return value

os (reference to the stream after insertion of the null character).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstdio>
#include <strstream>
 
int main()
{
    std::ostrstream oss;
    oss << "Sample text: " << 42 << std::ends;
    std::printf("%s\n", oss.str());
    oss.freeze(false); // enable memory deallocation
}

```

Output:

```
Sample text: 42

```
