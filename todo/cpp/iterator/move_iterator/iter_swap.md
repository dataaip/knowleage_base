|  |  |  |

Swaps the objects pointed to by two underlying iterators.

Equivalent to ranges::iter_swap(x.base(), y.base());.

This function template is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when std::move_iterator<Iter> is an associated class of the arguments.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x, y | - | move iterators to the elements to swap |

### Complexity

Constant.

### Exceptions

noexcept specification:noexcept(noexcept(ranges::iter_swap(x.base(), y.base())))

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<std::string> p{"AA", "EE"},
                             q{"ⱯⱯ", "ƎƎ"};
 
    std::move_iterator<std::vector<std::string>::iterator>
        x = std::make_move_iterator(p.begin()),
        y = std::make_move_iterator(q.begin());
 
    std::cout << *x << ' ' << *y << '\n';
 
    iter_swap(x, y); // ADL
 
    std::cout << *x << ' ' << *y << '\n';
}

```

Output:

```
AA ⱯⱯ
ⱯⱯ AA

```
