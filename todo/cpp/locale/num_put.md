| Member functions | | | | |

| Defined in header `<locale>` |  |  |
| template<   class CharT,      class OutputIt = std::ostreambuf_iterator<CharT> > class num_put; |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Class `std::num_put` encapsulates the rules for formatting numeric values as strings. Specifically, the types bool, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long(since C++11), double, long double, void\*, and of all types implicitly convertible to these (such as int or float) are supported. The standard formatting output operators (such as cout << n;) use the `std::num_put` facet of the I/O stream's locale to generate text representation of numbers.

Inheritance diagram

If a `std::num_put` specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its put() and do_put() are not guaranteed as specified.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<locale>` | |
| std::num_put<char> | creates narrow string representations of numbers |
| std::num_put<wchar_t> | creates wide string representations of numbers |

In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:

- `CharT` is one of
  - char,
  - wchar_t, and
  - any other implementation-defined character container type that meets the requirements for a character on which any of the iostream components can be instantiated; and
- `OutputIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `char_type` | `CharT` |
| `iter_type` | `OutputIt` |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member | Description |
| std::locale::id `id` [static] | the identifier of the facet |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a new `num_put` facet   (public member function) |
| put | invokes `do_put`   (public member function) |

### Protected member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (destructor) | destructs a `num_put` facet   (protected member function) |
| do_put[virtual] | formats a number and writes to output stream   (virtual protected member function) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    double n = 1234567.89;
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("de_DE.UTF-8"));
    std::cout << "Direct conversion to string:\n"
              << std::to_string(n) << '\n'
              << "Output using a german locale:\n"
              << std::fixed << n << '\n'
              << "Output using an american locale:\n";
 
    // use the facet directly
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
    auto& f = std::use_facet<std::num_put<char>>(std::cout.getloc());
    f.put(std::ostreambuf_iterator<char>(std::cout), std::cout, ' ', n);
    std::cout << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
Direct conversion to string:
1234567.890000
Output using a german locale:
1.234.567,890000
Output using an american locale:
1,234,567.890000

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 427 | C++98 | `num_put` was guaranteed to accept any `CharT` that meets the requirements for a character on which any of the iostream components can be instantiated | only guarantees to accept char, wchar_t and other implementation- defined character types |
| LWG 2392 | C++98 | only character type `CharT` could be guaranteed to be accepted by `num_put` | can guarantee to accept implementation- defined character container types |
