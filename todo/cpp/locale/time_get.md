|  |  |  |

Class template `std::time_get` encapsulates date and time parsing rules. The I/O manipulator std::get_time uses the `std::time_get` facet of the I/O stream's locale to convert text input to a std::tm object.

Inheritance diagram

If a `std::time_get` specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its member functions (except the constructor and destructor) are not guaranteed as specified.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale object):

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<locale>` | |
| std::time_get<char> | parses narrow string representations of date and time |
| std::time_get<wchar_t> | parses wide string representations of date and time |

In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:

- `CharT` is one of char and wchar_t, and
- `InputIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `char_type` | `CharT` |
| `iter_type` | `InputIt` |

### Data members

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member | Description |
| std::locale::id `id` [static] | the identifier of the facet |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs a new `time_get` facet   (public member function) |
| (destructor) | destructs a `time_get` facet   (protected member function) |
| date_order | invokes `do_date_order`   (public member function) |
| get_time | invokes `do_get_time`   (public member function) |
| get_date | invokes `do_get_date`   (public member function) |
| get_weekday | invokes `do_get_weekday`   (public member function) |
| get_monthname | invokes `do_get_monthname`   (public member function) |
| get_year | invokes `do_get_year`   (public member function) |
| get(C++11) | invokes `do_get`   (public member function) |

### Protected member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| do_date_order[virtual] | obtains preferred ordering of day, month, and year   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_get_time[virtual] | extracts hours, minutes, and seconds from input stream   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_get_date[virtual] | extracts month, day, and year from input stream   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_get_weekday[virtual] | extracts the name of a day of the week from input stream   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_get_monthname[virtual] | extracts a month name from input stream   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_get_year[virtual] | extracts a year from input stream   (virtual protected member function) |
| do_get[virtual] (C++11) | extracts date/time components from input stream, according to the specified format   (virtual protected member function) |

## Inherited from std::time_base

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `dateorder` | date order enumeration type, defining the values `no_order`, `dmy`, `mdy`, `ymd`, and `ydm` |

### Example

Note: choose clang to observe the output. libstdc++ does not correctly implement the %b specifier: bug 78714.

Run this code

```
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <sstream>
 
int main()
{
    std::tm t = {};
    std::istringstream ss("2011-Februar-18 23:12:34");
    ss.imbue(std::locale("de_DE.utf-8"));
 
    ss >> std::get_time(&t, "%Y-%b-%d %H:%M:%S");
    if (ss.fail())
        std::cout << "Parse failed\n";
    else
        std::cout << std::put_time(&t, "%c") << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
Sun Feb 18 23:12:34 2011

```
