| Defined in header `<locale>` |  |  |

|  |  |  |

`std::time_get_byname` is a std::time_get facet which encapsulates time and date parsing rules of the locale specified at its construction.

### Specializations

The standard library is guaranteed to provide every specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:

- `CharT` is one of char and wchar_t, and
- `InputIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `char_type` | `CharT` |
| `iter_type` | `InputIt` |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ****(constructor)**** | constructs a new `time_get_byname` facet   (public member function) |
| ****(destructor)**** | destroys a `time_get_byname` facet   (protected member function) |

## std::time_get_byname::time_get_byname

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| explicit time_get_byname( const char\* name, std::size_t refs = 0 ); |  |  |
| explicit time_get_byname( const std::string& name, std::size_t refs = 0 ); |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Constructs a new `std::time_get_byname` facet for a locale with name.

refs is used for resource management: if refs == 0, the implementation destroys the facet, when the last std::locale object holding it is destroyed. Otherwise, the object is not destroyed.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | - | the name of the locale |
| refs | - | the number of references that link to the facet |

## std::time_get_byname::~time_get_byname

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| protected:  ~time_get_byname(); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Destroys the facet.

## Inherited from std::time_get

| get(C++11) | invokes `do_get`   (public member function of `std::time_get<CharT,InputIt>`) |

### Protected member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| do_date_order[virtual] | obtains preferred ordering of day, month, and year   (virtual protected member function of `std::time_get<CharT,InputIt>`) |
| do_get_time[virtual] | extracts hours, minutes, and seconds from input stream   (virtual protected member function of `std::time_get<CharT,InputIt>`) |
| do_get_date[virtual] | extracts month, day, and year from input stream   (virtual protected member function of `std::time_get<CharT,InputIt>`) |
| do_get_weekday[virtual] | extracts the name of a day of the week from input stream   (virtual protected member function of `std::time_get<CharT,InputIt>`) |
| do_get_monthname[virtual] | extracts a month name from input stream   (virtual protected member function of `std::time_get<CharT,InputIt>`) |
| do_get_year[virtual] | extracts a year from input stream   (virtual protected member function of `std::time_get<CharT,InputIt>`) |
| do_get[virtual] (C++11) | extracts date/time components from input stream, according to the specified format   (virtual protected member function of `std::time_get<CharT,InputIt>`) |

## Inherited from std::time_base

### Nested types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `dateorder` | date order enumeration type, defining the values `no_order`, `dmy`, `mdy`, `ymd`, and `ydm` |
