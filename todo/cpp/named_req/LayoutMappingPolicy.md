****LayoutMappingPolicy**** is a type used to specify layout policy of std::mdspan. It provides a member alias template whose specialization is a LayoutMapping type.

### Requirements

A type `MP` satisfies LayoutMappingPolicy if the type requirements shown below are valid:

#### Legend

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Definition |
| `MP` | a layout mapping policy class |
| `M` | a layout mapping class |
| `E` | a specialization of std::extents |

#### Type requirements

- MP::mapping<E> is valid and denotes a type `M` that satisfies LayoutMapping.
- M::layout_type is valid and denotes a type `MP`.
- M::extents_type is valid and denotes a type `E`.

### Standard library

The following standard library types satisfy LayoutMappingPolicy requirements:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| layout_left(C++23) | column-major multidimensional array layout mapping policy; leftmost extent has stride `1`   (class) |
| layout_right(C++23) | row-major multidimensional array layout mapping policy; rightmost extent has stride `1`   (class) |
| layout_stride(C++23) | a layout mapping policy with user-defined strides   (class) |
| layout_left_padded(C++26) | column-major layout mapping policy with padding stride that can be greater than or equal to the leftmost extent   (class template) |
| layout_right_padded(C++26) | row-major layout mapping policy with padding stride that can be greater than or equal to the rightmost extent   (class template) |
| Defined in namespace `std::linalg` | |
| layout_transpose")(C++26) | std::mdspan layout mapping policy that swaps the rightmost two indices, extents, and strides of any unique layout mapping policy   (class template) |
| layout_blas_packed")(C++26) | std::mdspan layout mapping policy that represents a square matrix that stores only the entries in one triangle, in a packed contiguous format   (class template) |
