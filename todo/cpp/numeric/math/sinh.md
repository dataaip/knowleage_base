1-3) Computes the hyperbolic sine of num. The library provides overloads of `std::sinh` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter.(since C++23)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| S) The SIMD overload performs an element-wise `std::sinh` on v_num. (See **math-floating-point** and **deduced-simd-t** for their definitions.) | (since C++26) |

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are treated as double. | (since C++11) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| num | - | floating-point or integer value |

### Return value

If no errors occur, the hyperbolic sine of num (sinh(num), or 

|  |
| --- |
| enum -e-num |
| 2 |

) is returned.

If a range error due to overflow occurs, ±HUGE_VAL, `±HUGE_VALF`, or `±HUGE_VALL` is returned.

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

- if the argument is ±0 or ±∞, it is returned unmodified.
- if the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

### Notes

POSIX specifies that in case of underflow, num is returned unmodified, and if that is not supported, and implementation-defined value no greater than DBL_MIN, FLT_MIN, and LDBL_MIN is returned.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, std::sinh(num) has the same effect as std::sinh(static_cast<double>(num)).

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cerrno>
#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
 
int main()
{
    const double x = 42;
 
    std::cout << "sinh(1) = " << std::sinh(1) << '\n'
              << "sinh(-1) = " << std::sinh(-1) << '\n'
              << "log(sinh(" << x << ")+cosh(" << x << ")) = "
              << std::log(std::sinh(x) + std::cosh(x)) << '\n';
 
    // special values
    std::cout << "sinh(+0) = " << std::sinh(0.0) << '\n'
              << "sinh(-0) = " << std::sinh(-0.0) << '\n';
 
    // error handling
    errno = 0;
    std::feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);
 
    std::cout << "sinh(710.5) = " << std::sinh(710.5) << '\n';
 
    if (errno == ERANGE)
        std::cout << "    errno == ERANGE: " << std::strerror(errno) << '\n';
    if (std::fetestexcept(FE_OVERFLOW))
        std::cout << "    FE_OVERFLOW raised\n";
}

```

Output:

```
sinh(1) = 1.1752
sinh(-1) = -1.1752
log(sinh(42)+cosh(42)) = 42
sinh(+0) = 0
sinh(-0) = -0
sinh(710.5) = inf
    errno == ERANGE: Numerical result out of range
    FE_OVERFLOW raised

```
