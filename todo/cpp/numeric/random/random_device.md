|  |  |  |

`std::random_device` is a uniformly-distributed integer random number generator that produces non-deterministic random numbers.

`std::random_device` may be implemented in terms of an implementation-defined pseudo-random number engine if a non-deterministic source (e.g. a hardware device) is not available to the implementation. In this case each `std::random_device` object may generate the same number sequence.

### Member types

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Member type | Definition |
| `result_type` (C++11) | unsigned int |

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Construction | |
| (constructor) | constructs the engine   (public member function) |
| operator=(deleted) (C++11) | the assignment operator is deleted   (public member function) |
| Generation | |
| operator()") | advances the engine's state and returns the generated value   (public member function) |
| Characteristics | |
| entropy(C++11) | obtains the entropy estimate for the non-deterministic random number generator   (public member function) |
| min[static] | gets the smallest possible value in the output range   (public static member function) |
| max[static] | gets the largest possible value in the output range   (public static member function) |

### Notes

A notable implementation where `std::random_device` is deterministic in old versions of MinGW-w64 (bug 338, fixed since GCC 9.2). The latest MinGW-w64 versions can be downloaded from GCC with the MCF thread model.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <random>
#include <string>
 
int main()
{
    std::random_device rd;
    std::map<int, int> hist;
    std::uniform_int_distribution<int> dist(0, 9);
 
    for (int n = 0; n != 20000; ++n)
        ++hist[dist(rd)]; // note: demo only: the performance of many
                          // implementations of random_device degrades sharply
                          // once the entropy pool is exhausted. For practical use
                          // random_device is generally only used to seed
                          // a PRNG such as mt19937
 
    for (auto [x, y] : hist)
        std::cout << x << " : " << std::string(y / 100, '*') << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
