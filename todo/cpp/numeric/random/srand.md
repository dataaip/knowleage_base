| Defined in header `<cstdlib>` |  |  |
| void srand( unsigned seed ); |  |  |
|  |  |  |

Seeds the pseudo-random number generator used by std::rand() with the value `seed`.

If std::rand() is used before any calls to `srand()`, std::rand() behaves as if it was seeded with srand(1).

Each time std::rand() is seeded with the same `seed`, it must produce the same sequence of values.

`srand()` is not guaranteed to be thread-safe.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| seed | - | the seed value |

### Return value

(none)

### Notes

Generally speaking, the pseudo-random number generator should only be seeded once, before any calls to `rand()`, at the start of the program.
It should not be repeatedly seeded, or reseeded every time you wish to generate a new batch of pseudo-random numbers.

Standard practice is to use the result of a call to std::time(0) as the seed.
However, std::time returns a std::time_t value, and std::time_t is not guaranteed to be an integral type.
In practice, though, every major implementation defines std::time_t to be an integral type, and this is also what POSIX requires.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
 
int main() 
{
    std::srand(std::time(0)); // use current time as seed for random generator
    std::cout << "Random value on [0, " << RAND_MAX << "]: " << std::rand() << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
Random value on [0, 2147483647]: 1373858591

```
