Returns an iterator to the last element of the argument.

!range-rbegin-rend.svg

If `T` is an array type and std::remove_all_extents_t<std::remove_reference_t<T>> is incomplete, then the call to `ranges::rbegin` is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.

If the argument is an lvalue or ranges::enable_borrowed_range<std::remove_cv_t<T>> is true, then a call to `ranges::rbegin` is expression-equivalent to:

1. **decay-copy**(t.rbegin())(until C++23)auto(t.rbegin())(since C++23), if that expression is valid and its type models std::input_or_output_iterator.
2. Otherwise, **decay-copy**(rbegin(t))(until C++23)auto(rbegin(t))(since C++23), if `T` is a class or enumeration type, that expression is valid and its type models std::input_or_output_iterator, where the meaning of `rbegin` is established as if by performing argument-dependent lookup only.
3. Otherwise, std::make_reverse_iterator(ranges::end(t)) if both ranges::begin(t) and ranges::end(t) are valid expressions, have the same type, and that type models std::bidirectional_iterator.

In all other cases, a call to `ranges::rbegin` is ill-formed, which can result in substitution failure when ranges::rbegin(t) appears in the immediate context of a template instantiation.

### Customization point objects

The name `ranges::rbegin` denotes a **customization point object**, which is a const function object of a literal `semiregular` class type. For exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted as `__rbegin_fn`.

All instances of `__rbegin_fn` are equal. The effects of invoking different instances of type `__rbegin_fn` on the same arguments are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, `ranges::rbegin` can be copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

Given a set of types `Args...`, if std::declval<Args>()... meet the requirements for arguments to `ranges::rbegin` above, `__rbegin_fn` models

- std::invocable<__rbegin_fn, Args...>,
- std::invocable<const __rbegin_fn, Args...>,
- std::invocable<__rbegin_fn&, Args...>, and
- std::invocable<const __rbegin_fn&, Args...>.

Otherwise, no function call operator of `__rbegin_fn` participates in overload resolution.

### Notes

If the argument is an rvalue (i.e. `T` is an object type) and ranges::enable_borrowed_range<std::remove_cv_t<T>> is false, the call to `ranges::rbegin` is ill-formed, which also results in substitution failure.

The return type models std::input_or_output_iterator in all cases.

The C++20 standard requires that if the underlying `rbegin` function call returns a prvalue, the return value is move-constructed from the materialized temporary object. All implementations directly return the prvalue instead. The requirement is corrected by the post-C++20 proposal P0849R8 to match the implementations.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <span>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v = {3, 1, 4};
    auto vi = std::ranges::rbegin(v);
    std::cout << *vi << '\n';
    *vi = 42; // OK
 
    int a[] = {-5, 10, 15};
    auto ai = std::ranges::rbegin(a);
    std::cout << *ai << '\n';
    *ai = 42; // OK
 
    // auto x_x = std::ranges::rbegin(std::vector{6, 6, 6});
    // ill-formed: the argument is an rvalue (see Notes ↑)
 
    auto si = std::ranges::rbegin(std::span{a}); // OK
    static_assert(std::ranges::enable_borrowed_range<
        std::remove_cv_t<decltype(std::span{a})>>);
    *si = 42; // OK
}

```

Output:

```

15

```
