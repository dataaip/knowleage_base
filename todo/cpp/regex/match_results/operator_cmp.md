| template< class BidirIt, class Alloc >  bool operator==( match_results<BidirIt,Alloc>& lhs,                  match_results<BidirIt,Alloc>& rhs ); | (1) | (since C++11) |
| template< class BidirIt, class Alloc >  bool operator!=( match_results<BidirIt,Alloc>& lhs,                  match_results<BidirIt,Alloc>& rhs ); | (2) | (since C++11)  (until C++20) |
|  |  |  |

Compares two `match_results` objects.

Two `match_results` are equal if the following conditions are met:

- neither of the objects is **ready**, **or**
- both match results are **ready** and the following conditions are met:

:   - lhs.empty() and rhs.empty(), **or**
    - !lhs.empty() and !rhs.empty() and the following conditions are met:

    :   - lhs.prefix() == rhs.prefix()
        - lhs.size() == rhs.size() && std::equal(lhs.begin(), lhs.end(), rhs.begin())
        - lhs.suffix() == rhs.suffix()

1) Checks if lhs and rhs are equal.2) Checks if lhs and rhs are not equal.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The `!=` operator is synthesized from `operator==`. | (since C++20) |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| lhs, rhs | - | match results to compare |
| Type requirements | | |
| -`BidirIt` must meet the requirements of LegacyBidirectionalIterator. | | |
| -`Alloc` must meet the requirements of Allocator. | | |

### Return value

1) true if lhs and rhs are equal, false otherwise.2) true if lhs and rhs are not equal, false otherwise.

### Exceptions

May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
