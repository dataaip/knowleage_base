| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<mutex>` |  |  |
| template< class Callable, class... Args >  void call_once( std::once_flag& flag, Callable&& f, Args&&... args ); |  | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

Executes the Callable object f exactly once, even if called concurrently from several threads.

In detail:

- If, by the time `std::call_once` is called, flag indicates that f was already called, `std::call_once` returns right away (such a call to `std::call_once` is known as **passive**).

- Otherwise, `std::call_once` calls **INVOKE**(std::forward<Callable>(f), std::forward<Args>(args)...). Unlike the std::thread constructor or std::async, the arguments are not moved or copied because they do not need to be transferred to another thread of execution (such a call to `std::call_once` is known as **active**).

:   - If that invocation throws an exception, it is propagated to the caller of `std::call_once`, and flag is not flipped so that another call will be attempted (such a call to `std::call_once` is known as **exceptional** ﻿).
    - If that invocation returns normally (such a call to `std::call_once` is known as **returning**), flag is flipped, and all other calls to `std::call_once` with the same flag are guaranteed to be **passive**.

All **active** calls on the same flag form a single total order consisting of zero or more **exceptional** calls, followed by one **returning** call. The end of each **active** call synchronizes-with the next **active** call in that order.

The return from the **returning** call synchronizes-with the returns from all **passive** calls on the same flag: this means that all concurrent calls to `std::call_once` are guaranteed to observe any side-effects made by the **active** call, with no additional synchronization.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| flag | - | an object, for which exactly one function gets executed |
| f | - | Callable object to invoke |
| args... | - | arguments to pass to the function |

### Return value

(none)

### Exceptions

- std::system_error if any condition prevents calls to `std::call_once` from executing as specified.
- Any exception thrown by f.

### Notes

If concurrent calls to `std::call_once` pass different functions f, it is unspecified which f will be called. The selected function runs in the same thread as the `std::call_once` invocation it was passed to.

Initialization of function-local statics is guaranteed to occur only once even when called from multiple threads, and may be more efficient than the equivalent code using `std::call_once`.

The POSIX equivalent of this function is `pthread_once`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>
 
std::once_flag flag1, flag2;
 
void simple_do_once()
{
    std::call_once(flag1, [](){ std::cout << "Simple example: called once\n"; });
}
 
void may_throw_function(bool do_throw)
{
    if (do_throw)
    {
        std::cout << "Throw: call_once will retry\n"; // this may appear more than once
        throw std::exception();
    }
    std::cout << "Did not throw, call_once will not attempt again\n"; // guaranteed once
}
 
void do_once(bool do_throw)
{
    try
    {
        std::call_once(flag2, may_throw_function, do_throw);
    }
    catch (...) {}
}
 
int main()
{
    std::thread st1(simple_do_once);
    std::thread st2(simple_do_once);
    std::thread st3(simple_do_once);
    std::thread st4(simple_do_once);
    st1.join();
    st2.join();
    st3.join();
    st4.join();
 
    std::thread t1(do_once, true);
    std::thread t2(do_once, true);
    std::thread t3(do_once, false);
    std::thread t4(do_once, true);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();
    t4.join();
}

```

Possible output:

```
Simple example: called once
Throw: call_once will retry
Throw: call_once will retry
Throw: call_once will retry
Did not throw, call_once will not attempt again

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2080 | C++11 | std::invalid_argument would be thrown if f is invalid, but the scenario where f is invalidated is not specified | removed this error condition |
| LWG 2442 | C++11 | the arguments were copied and/or moved before invocation | no copying/moving is performed |
