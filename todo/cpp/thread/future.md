****std::future****

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Member functions | | | | |
| future::future | | | | |
| future::~future | | | | |
| future::operator= | | | | |
| future::share | | | | |
| Getting the result | | | | |
| future::get | | | | |
| State | | | | |
| future::valid | | | | |
| future::wait | | | | |
| future::wait_for | | | | |
| future::wait_until | | | | |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defined in header `<future>` |  |  |
| template< class T > class future; | (1) | (since C++11) |
| template< class T > class future<T&>; | (2) | (since C++11) |
| template<> class future<void>; | (3) | (since C++11) |
|  |  |  |

The class template `std::future` provides a mechanism to access the result of asynchronous operations:

- An asynchronous operation (created via std::async, std::packaged_task, or std::promise) can provide a `std::future` object to the creator of that asynchronous operation.

- The creator of the asynchronous operation can then use a variety of methods to query, wait for, or extract a value from the `std::future`. These methods may block if the asynchronous operation has not yet provided a value.

- When the asynchronous operation is ready to send a result to the creator, it can do so by modifying **shared state** (e.g. std::promise::set_value) that is linked to the creator's `std::future`.

Note that `std::future` references shared state that is not shared with any other asynchronous return objects (as opposed to std::shared_future).

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor) | constructs the future object   (public member function) |
| (destructor) | destructs the future object   (public member function) |
| operator= | moves the future object   (public member function) |
| share | transfers the shared state from \*this to a shared_future and returns it   (public member function) |
| Getting the result | |
| get | returns the result   (public member function) |
| State | |
| valid | checks if the future has a shared state   (public member function) |
| wait | waits for the result to become available   (public member function) |
| wait_for | waits for the result, returns if it is not available for the specified timeout duration   (public member function) |
| wait_until | waits for the result, returns if it is not available until specified time point has been reached   (public member function) |

### Examples

Run this code

```
#include <future>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
int main()
{
    // future from a packaged_task
    std::packaged_task<int()> task([]{ return 7; }); // wrap the function
    std::future<int> f1 = task.get_future(); // get a future
    std::thread t(std::move(task)); // launch on a thread
 
    // future from an async()
    std::future<int> f2 = std::async(std::launch::async, []{ return 8; });
 
    // future from a promise
    std::promise<int> p;
    std::future<int> f3 = p.get_future();
    std::thread([&p]{ p.set_value_at_thread_exit(9); }).detach();
 
    std::cout << "Waiting..." << std::flush;
    f1.wait();
    f2.wait();
    f3.wait();
    std::cout << "Done!\nResults are: "
              << f1.get() << ' ' << f2.get() << ' ' << f3.get() << '\n';
    t.join();
}

```

Output:

```
Waiting...Done!
Results are: 7 8 9

```

#### Example with exceptions

Run this code

```
#include <future>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
 
int main()
{
    std::promise<int> p;
    std::future<int> f = p.get_future();
 
    std::thread t([&p]
    {
        try
        {
            // code that may throw
            throw std::runtime_error("Example");
        }
        catch (...)
        {
            try
            {
                // store anything thrown in the promise
                p.set_exception(std::current_exception());
            }
            catch (...) {} // set_exception() may throw too
        }
    });
 
    try
    {
        std::cout << f.get();
    }
    catch (const std::exception& e)
    {
        std::cout << "Exception from the thread: " << e.what() << '\n';
    }
    t.join();
}

```

Output:

```
Exception from the thread: Example

```
