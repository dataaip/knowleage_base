Performs type-safe access to the contained object.

Let `U` be std::remove_cv_t<std::remove_reference_t<T>>.

1) The program is ill-formed if std::is_constructible_v<T, const U&> is false.2) The program is ill-formed if std::is_constructible_v<T, U&> is false.3) The program is ill-formed if std::is_constructible_v<T, U> is false.4,5) The program is ill-formed if std::is_void_v<T> is true.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| operand | - | target `any` object |

### Return value

1,2) Returns static_cast<T>(\*std::any_cast<U>(&operand)).3) Returns static_cast<T>(std::move(\*std::any_cast<U>(&operand))).4,5) If operand is not a null pointer, and the typeid of the requested `T` matches that of the contents of operand, a pointer to the value contained by operand, otherwise a null pointer.

### Exceptions

1-3) Throws std::bad_any_cast if the typeid of the requested `T` does not match that of the contents of operand.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <any>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <type_traits>
#include <utility>
 
int main()
{
    // Simple example
    auto a1 = std::any(12);
    std::cout << "1) a1 is int: " << std::any_cast<int>(a1) << '\n';
 
    try
    {
        auto s = std::any_cast<std::string>(a1); // throws
    }
    catch (const std::bad_any_cast& e)
    {
        std::cout << "2) " << e.what() << '\n';
    }
 
    // Pointer example
    if (int* i = std::any_cast<int>(&a1))
        std::cout << "3) a1 is int: " << *i << '\n';
    else if (std::string* s = std::any_cast<std::string>(&a1))
        std::cout << "3) a1 is std::string: " << *s << '\n';
    else
        std::cout << "3) a1 is another type or unset\n";
 
    // Advanced example
    a1 = std::string("hello");
    auto& ra = std::any_cast<std::string&>(a1); // reference
    ra[1] = 'o';
 
    std::cout << "4) a1 is string: "
              << std::any_cast<const std::string&>(a1) << '\n'; // const reference
 
    auto s1 = std::any_cast<std::string&&>(std::move(a1)); // rvalue reference
    // Note: “s1” is a move-constructed std::string:
    static_assert(std::is_same_v<decltype(s1), std::string>);
 
    // Note: the std::string in “a1” is left in valid but unspecified state
    std::cout << "5) a1.size(): "
              << std::any_cast<std::string>(&a1)->size() // pointer
              << '\n'
              << "6) s1: " << s1 << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
1) a1 is int: 12
2) bad any_cast
3) a1 is int: 12
4) a1 is string: hollo
5) a1.size(): 0
6) s1: hollo

```

### Defect reports

The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 3305 | C++17 | the behavior of overloads (4,5) was unclear if `T` is void | the program ill-formed in this case |
