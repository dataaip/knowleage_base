A function object that binds an argument to a binary function.

The value of the parameter is passed to the object at the construction time and stored within the object. Whenever the function object is invoked though `operator()`, the stored value is passed as one of the arguments, the other argument is passed as an argument of `operator()`. The resulting function object is a unary function.

1) Binds the first parameter to the value value given at the construction of the object.2) Binds the second parameter to the value value given at the construction of the object.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cmath>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 
const double pi = std::acos(-1); // use std::numbers::pi in C++20
 
int main()
{
    // deprecated in C++11, removed in C++17
    auto f1 = std::bind1st(std::multiplies<double>(), pi / 180.0);
 
    // C++11 replacement
    auto f2 = [](double a) { return a * pi / 180.0; };
 
    for (double n : {0, 30, 45, 60, 90, 180})
        std::cout << n << "°\t" << std::fixed << "= "
                  << f1(n) << " rad (using binder)\t= "
                  << f2(n) << " rad (using lambda)\n"
                  << std::defaultfloat;
}

```

Output:

```
0°	= 0.000000 rad (using binder)	= 0.000000 rad (using lambda)
30°	= 0.523599 rad (using binder)	= 0.523599 rad (using lambda)
45°	= 0.785398 rad (using binder)	= 0.785398 rad (using lambda)
60°	= 1.047198 rad (using binder)	= 1.047198 rad (using lambda)
90°	= 1.570796 rad (using binder)	= 1.570796 rad (using lambda)
180°	= 3.141593 rad (using binder)	= 3.141593 rad (using lambda)

```
