| Defined in header `<debugging>` |  |  |
| bool is_debugger_present() noexcept; |  | (since C++26) |
|  |  |  |

Attempts to determine if the program is being executed with debugger present.

By default, the behavior of this function is completely implementation-defined. A C++ program may provide the definition of this signature to replace the behavior of this function.

### Return value

The default version returns true if, to the best of its knowledge, the program is executed under a debugger.

### Notes

The intent of this function is allowing printing out extra output to help diagnose problems, executing extra test code, displaying an extra user interface to help in debugging, etc.

This function standardizes many similar existing facilities: `under_debugger` from boost.test, `IsDebuggerPresent()` from Win32 API, `isDebuggerActive` from Catch2, `IsDebuggerPresent` from Unreal Engine, etc.
