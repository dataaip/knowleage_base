1-4) Extracts the Ith element from the tuple. I must be an integer value in ``​0​`,`sizeof...(Types)`)`.5-8) Extracts the element of the tuple t whose type is `T`. Fails to compile unless the tuple has exactly one element of that type.

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| t | - | tuple whose contents to extract |

### Return value

A reference to the selected element of t.

### Notes

| [Feature-test macro | Value | Std | Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `__cpp_lib_tuples_by_type` | `201304L` | (C++14) | Addressing tuples by type (5-8) |

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <tuple>
 
int main()
{
    auto x = std::make_tuple(1, "Foo", 3.14);
 
    // Index-based access
    std::cout << "( " << std::get<0>(x)
              << ", " << std::get<1>(x)
              << ", " << std::get<2>(x)
              << " )\n";
 
    // Type-based access (since C++14)
    std::cout << "( " << std::get<int>(x)
              << ", " << std::get<const char*>(x)
              << ", " << std::get<double>(x)
              << " )\n";
 
    const std::tuple<int, const int, double, double> y(1, 2, 6.9, 9.6);
    const int& i1 = std::get<int>(y); // OK: not ambiguous
    assert(i1 == 1);
    const int& i2 = std::get<const int>(y); // OK: not ambiguous
    assert(i2 == 2);
    // const double& d = std::get<double>(y); // Error: ill-formed (ambiguous)
 
    // Note: std::tie and structured binding can be
    // used to unpack a tuple into individual objects.
}

```

Output:

```
( 1, Foo, 3.14 )
( 1, Foo, 3.14 )

```

### Defect reports

| DR | Applied to | Behavior as published | Correct behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LWG 2485 | C++11 (by index) C++14 (by type) | there are no overloads for const tuple&& | added these overloads ((4) and (8)) |
