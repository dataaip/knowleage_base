|  |  |  |

Constructs a tuple that is a concatenation of all tuples in args. The element types /\* CTypes \*/ of the returned tuple is formed by concatenating the elements type packs of all std::tuple(until C++23)`tuple-like`(since C++23) types in `Tuples` in order.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The behavior is undefined if any type in std::decay_t<Tuples>... is not a specialization of std::tuple. However, an implementation may choose to support types (such as std::array and std::pair) that follow the tuple-like protocol. | (until C++23) |
| The types std::decay_t<Tuples>... are constrained to be tuple-like, i.e. each type therein is required to be a specialization of std::tuple or another type (such as std::array and std::pair) that models `tuple-like`. | (since C++23) |

If any type in /\* CTypes \*/ is not constructible from the type of the corresponding element in the sequence of elements concatenated from args, the behavior is undefined(until C++23)the program is ill-formed(since C++23).

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| args | - | zero or more tuples to concatenate |

### Return value

A std::tuple object composed of all elements of all argument tuples constructed from std::get<j>(std::forward<Ti>(arg)) for each individual element.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <tuple>
 
// helper function to print a tuple of any size
template<class Tuple, std::size_t N>
struct TuplePrinter
{
    static void print(const Tuple& t)
    {
        TuplePrinter<Tuple, N - 1>::print(t);
        std::cout << ", " << std::get<N-1>(t);
    }
};
 
template<class Tuple>
struct TuplePrinter<Tuple, 1>
{
    static void print(const Tuple& t)
    {
        std::cout << std::get<0>(t);
    }
};
 
template<typename... Args, std::enable_if_t<sizeof...(Args) == 0, int> = 0>
void print(const std::tuple<Args...>& t)
{
    std::cout << "()\n";
}
 
template<typename... Args, std::enable_if_t<sizeof...(Args) != 0, int> = 0>
void print(const std::tuple<Args...>& t)
{
    std::cout << "(";
    TuplePrinter<decltype(t), sizeof...(Args)>::print(t);
    std::cout << ")\n";
}
// end helper function
 
int main()
{
    std::tuple<int, std::string, float> t1(10, "Test", 3.14);
    int n = 7;
    auto t2 = std::tuple_cat(t1, std::make_tuple("Foo", "bar"), t1, std::tie(n));
    n = 42;
    print(t2);
}

```

Output:

```
(10, Test, 3.14, Foo, bar, 10, Test, 3.14, 42)

```
