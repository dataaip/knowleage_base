1) Index-based value accessor: If v.index() == I, returns a reference to the value stored in v. Otherwise, throws std::bad_variant_access. The call is ill-formed if `I` is not a valid index in the variant.2) Type-based value accessor: If v holds the alternative `T`, returns a reference to the value stored in v. Otherwise, throws std::bad_variant_access. The call is ill-formed if `T` is not a unique element of Types....

### Template parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I | - | index to look up |
| T | - | unique type to look up |
| Types... | - | types forming the `variant` |

### Parameters

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v | - | a `variant` |

### Return value

Reference to the value stored in the variant.

### Exceptions

1,2) Throws std::bad_variant_access on errors.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <variant>
 
int main()
{
    std::variant<int, float> v{12}, w;
    std::cout << std::get<int>(v) << '\n';
    w = std::get<int>(v);
    w = std::get<0>(v); // same effect as the previous line
 
//  std::get<double>(v); // error: no double in [int, float]
//  std::get<3>(v);      // error: valid index values are 0 and 1
 
    try
    {
        w = 42.0f;
        std::cout << std::get<float>(w) << '\n'; // ok, prints 42
        w = 42;
        std::cout << std::get<float>(w) << '\n'; // throws
    }
    catch (std::bad_variant_access const& ex)
    {
        std::cout << ex.what() << ": w contained int, not float\n";
    }
}

```

Possible output:

```
12
42
Unexpected index: w contained int, not float

```
