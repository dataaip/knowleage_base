| Defined in header `<variant>` |  |  |
| Defined in header `<utility>` |  | (since C++26) |
| struct monostate { }; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Unit type intended for use as a well-behaved empty alternative in std::variant. In particular, a variant of non-default-constructible types may list `std::monostate` as its first alternative: this makes the variant itself default-constructible.

### Member functions

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor)(implicitly declared) | trivial implicit default/copy/move constructor   (public member function) |
| (destructor)(implicitly declared) | trivial implicit destructor   (public member function) |
| operator=(implicitly declared) | trivial implicit copy/move assignment   (public member function) |

### Non-member functions

## std::operator==, !=, <, <=, >, >=, <=>(std::monostate)

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| constexpr bool operator==( monostate, monostate ) noexcept { return true; } | (1) | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | (2) |  |
| constexpr bool operator!=( monostate, monostate ) noexcept { return false; }  constexpr bool operator< ( monostate, monostate ) noexcept { return false; }  constexpr bool operator> ( monostate, monostate ) noexcept { return false; }  constexpr bool operator<=( monostate, monostate ) noexcept { return true; } constexpr bool operator>=( monostate, monostate ) noexcept { return true; } |  | (since C++17)  (until C++20) |
| constexpr std::strong_ordering operator<=>( monostate, monostate ) noexcept  {      return std::strong_ordering::equal; } |  | (since C++20) |
|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |

All instances of `std::monostate` compare equal.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| The `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, and `!=` operators are synthesized from operator<=> and operator== respectively. | (since C++20) |

### Helper classes

## std::hash<std::monostate>

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| template <>  struct std::hash<monostate>; |  | (since C++17) |
|  |  |  |

Specializes the std::hash algorithm for `std::monostate`.

### Example

Run this code

```
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include <variant>
 
struct S
{
    S(int i) : i(i) {}
    int i;
};
 
int main()
{
    // Without the monostate type this declaration will fail.
    // This is because S is not default-constructible.
    std::variant<std::monostate, S> var;
    assert(var.index() == 0);
 
    try
    {
        std::get<S>(var); // throws! We need to assign a value
    }
    catch(const std::bad_variant_access& e)
    {
        std::cout << e.what() << '\n';
    }
 
    var = 42;
    std::cout << "std::get: " << std::get<S>(var).i << '\n'
              << "std::hash: " << std::hex << std::showbase
              << std::hash<std::monostate>{}(std::monostate{}) << '\n';
}

```

Possible output:

```
std::get: wrong index for variant
std::get: 42
std::hash: 0xffffffffffffe19f

```
